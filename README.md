# AWS-Home-Automation-App
This is my final year project work. It is a Home automation application system based on IOT using Amazon Web Services. In this system we can lock/unlock the main door by facial recognition and android mobile application. We can also control some home appliances like speed of fan, turning on/off lights or AC or TV using the mobile application .
User need Specific Customer EndPoint to Connect to Amazon.
User can operate using the system that we have made.
